Symbl's APIs empower developers to enable: 

- **Real-time** analysis of free-flowing discussions to automatically surface highly relevant summary discussion topics, contextual insights, suggestive action items, follow-ups, decisions, and questions.\
- **Voice APIs** that makes it easy to add AI-powered conversational intelligence to either [telephony][telephony] or [WebSocket][websocket] interfaces.
- **Conversation APIs** that provide a REST interface for managing and processing your conversation data.
- **Summary UI** with a fully customizable and editable reference experience that indexes a searchable transcript and shows generated actionable insights, topics, timecodes, and speaker information.
